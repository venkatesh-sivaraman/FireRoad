<br>Introduces probability and statistics with an emphasis on understanding, quantifying, and modeling uncertainty. Topics include events and their probability, the total probability and Bayes' theorems, discrete and continuous random variables and vectors, covariance, correlations, and conditional analysis. Random sampling, estimation of distribution parameters (method of moments, maximum likelihood, Bayesian estimation), and simple and multiple linear regression. Concepts illustrated with examples from various areas of engineering and everyday life. Integrates applications with statistical computing and graphics.

<br>Develops skills to evaluate a project or program using economic, environmental, and equity metrics, and to plan, execute and manage its progress to completion. Introduces students to engineering projects that are typically large-scale and long-lived, and involve many economic, financial, social and environmental factors. Covers net present value analysis, life-cycle costing, and benefit-cost analysis. Culminates in a term project in which small teams study a historical or prospective project of their choosing. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication provided.
